# Second Life - Clear out your wardrobe. Give clothes back people in need.

This dynamic website is powered by [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The idea was, to design tool for managing the wardrobe. If some of your staff is unused,  you can give it back to charity foundations or local collections. Just fill in the form. I've used React-Router for navigation, React hooks for managing the state and I've styled this application with the use of SASS.

## Content

**The application consists of two sections:**
- **Home** that encourages the use of the application
- **FormCore** that allows adding items to trasnsfer to charity organizations etc. User can specify where and to whom to give back the items. 
App contains sign up, sign in, and sign out module.
